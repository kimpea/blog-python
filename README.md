# Gamers Unite Blog Site

## Brief

Create a blog site with Python and use MongoDB as the database which stores all of the blog posts and user data. 

## UX

This web application is made for users who would like to create/read posts about the gaming industry, new upcoming games and what games are trending now. My target market will be of any age group but will most importantly be those interested in video games, mobile games, VR and technology in general. This type of user will want to have their own account allowing them to create, edit or delete their own blog posts and also to be able to view blog posts made by other users. This user may also want to be able to comment on various blog posts. These posts will need to be organised into their own categories such as 'VR', 'MMOs', 'Console games' and more. My project is a suitable way of achieving this because it will contain an authentication form for login and registration, forms for creating and editing posts, filters that will filter out posts by their categories and a form to make a comment on a post.
